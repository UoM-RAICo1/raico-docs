To charge the robot, follow these steps:

    #. Connect the power adapter to the charger and the output cable between charger and ROSbot (2 connectors on charger side, 1 black connector to ROSbot charging port).
    #. Use ``red and blue buttons`` to select `LiPo BATT` mode and press [Start].
    #. Use arrows to select `LiPo CHARGE` mode.
    #. Press ``Start`` - the current value should start blinking. Use arrows to set the current to 1.5A.
    #. Press ``Start`` again - the voltage value should start blinking. Select ``11.1V(3S)`` using arrows. The picture below shows the desired result.
    #. Press and hold ``Start`` for 2 seconds. The charger should now ask for confirmation. Press ``Start`` again. The charging process should begin now.
    #. When the charging will be finished (after about 3 hours), the charger will generate a loud ``beep`` sound and will finish charging at the same time.
