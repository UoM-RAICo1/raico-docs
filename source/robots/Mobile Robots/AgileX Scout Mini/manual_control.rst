Manual Control
==============

To control the :ref:`AgileX Scout Mini` manually, you can use the controller.
Once the controller is on (check :ref:`powering_on_remote_controller` for turning on the controller), you can start driving the robot.
To do so, follow the step below:

.. note:: Move the middle left toggle switch to its middle position to enable the driving mode.

.. note:: Release the Emergency button before starting to control the robot.

Moving
------

To move the robot, use the left joystick. Pushing the joystick forward will make the robot move forward, and pulling it back will make the robot move backward.
Pushing the right joystick to the left or right will make the robot turn left or right, respectively.

.. .. note::  If the robot is not moving and you hear a buzzing sound coming from the back of the AgileX robot when actuating the joypad, check whether one of the Emergency buttons are pressed. Release if pressed and try again to teleoperate the robot.
