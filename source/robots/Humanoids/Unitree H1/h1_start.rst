H1 Start Up
===========

For starting up the H1, first of all we need to prepare the robot into the proper position and then turn on the power.


Boot process
------------

To prepare the robot for startup, follow these steps:

    #. Place H1 on the ground and secure it with a rope tied in a dead knot at H1’s shoulder latch.
    #. Hang the rope on the clasp of the protective frame to support H1.
    #. Raise H1 along with the protective frame to prepare for startup.
    #. Insert two batteries into the battery compartment with the key-forward orientation.
    #. Turn the arm inward until it reaches its limit and then lower it vertically.
    #. Ensure that the feet are cocked up to their limit.
    #. Maintain the position as depicted in the image below.
    #. Short press and long press both batteries simultaneously to power them up.
    #. Wait until you hear the sound indicating that the ankle has reached its limit, and then wait an additional 30 seconds.
    #. Press L1+A to unlock damping, then press R2+X to enter ready mode. At this point, the feet will spread out, and the arms will be at the sides of the waist.
    #. Lower the H1 with the protective frame until H1’s feet touch the ground and the fuselage remains stable.
    #. Press R2+X again to activate Sport Mode, and H1 will start marching in place.
    #. Press START to switch to standing mode, then lower the hook and remove the rope.
