**Horizontal type startup:** please make sure that the robot dog is placed on a flat ground before startup and operation.
The belly support pad of the robot dog should be flat against the ground.
The machine body should lie on the ground horizontally without tilting.
The legs of the robot dog should be fully retracted as shown in :numref:`b1_body_placement`.
The four knee joints and foot ends should be flat on the ground to ensure that neither the thighs nor the legs of the robot dog are pressed by the machine body.
