Connect to a PC
=================

This page describes how to connect to a PC using the `Ethernet` port or via `WiFi`.

.. note:: Firstly read the information on page 68 of the `User Guide` linked at :ref:`Kinova Gen3`.

To work with a PC do the following:
    - Connect the `Ethernet` port to the PC using an `Ethernet` cable.
    - Power on the robot. [Find the powering on instructions at :ref:`Kinova Gen3 Starting Up`]
    - Open a browser and enter the IP address `192.168.1.10` in the address bar.
    - Login with the username `admin` and password `admin`.

Now you can access the robot's web interface.
