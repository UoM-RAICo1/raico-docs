Installation
------------

When securing the robotic arm, the user should design and install the platform based on the dimensions of the holes
in the robotic arm base and the actual environment. The platform must support not only the weight of the robotic arm
but also the dynamic forces generated during maximum acceleration. The robotic arm is fastened using four M6 bolts,
and installation is performed with a hex wrench. Please refer to the base installation details in :numref:`z1_base`.

Cable Connection
----------------

There are two primary types of robotic arm cables:
power supply cables and telecommunication cables.
The power supply cable connector for the robotic arm is designed with a mistake-proof feature,
ensuring correct insertion into the power supply port. Please refer to the figure below for proper connection. See :numref:`z1_cable` for details.

.. note::

    The main network port is designated for controlling the robot, while the auxiliary network port is intended for changing the default IP address. These ports should not be interchanged.

    Additionally, the power supply is not hot-swappable.
